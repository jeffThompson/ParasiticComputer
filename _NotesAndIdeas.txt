- open obj in fusion
	- insert mesh
	- move and scale as needed
- choose mesh
	- modify > mesh > mesh to brep

heatsink notes
- thinning not good
- branching seems to help too?

- work better when air is much cooler than source (req for convection)
	- probably not good under clothes then
		- back of neck?
	- might work best in very cold data centers!
	- shoot video there?

1.4–2.1mg copper per kg of body weight
- typical ingestion 5mg/day, only 20–50% absorbed
- helps make red blood cells, collagen
- deficiency would result from the leeching
- would cause anemia, low white blood cell count
	- can also cause low body temp – maybe way to raise that too?

- maybe the urge to eat whole grain cereals, legumes, oysters, liver, cherries, dark choc,
  fruits, leafy green veg, nuts, prunes, and soy products (which are high in copper)

NiMH battery
titanium or vanadium (neither found in body, va found in pepper, radishes, eggs, buckwheat and oats)
nickel (found in body via nuts, beans and peas, chocolate) w chromium (found in body via meat, potato skin, cheese, molasses, and hard tap water), cobalt, iron (dark choc, lentils, spinach, pump seeds, tofu, or manganese (leaf veg, tea, beans, seeds, whole grains)

feeding is the main idea around parasites (and being unwanted)

Media Parasites in the Early Avant-Garde
A. Niebisch

Greek root of parasite: para meaning "beside" and sitos meaning "grain"

"[this definition] indicates that the parasite exists next to its nourishing host."

"[Avant-garde artists] engaged with these ideas without obeying the laws of the university or the rigidity of engineering. The avant-garde arbitrarily took from these discourse and reassembled such fragments in order to proclaim the dawn of a new man or era that would emerge from an accelerated modernity."

Shannon's theory: parasite of the "univited interceptor" of a secret message "that feasts on every signal transmitted through the communication lines".

"Parasitic" used in ee to describe irritations or static in trans channel (note 23)

parasites create dynamic systems, and Serres argues that "the parasite is not simply an outside intruder, but the index for the complexity in a system. This is an ecological turn, b/c Serres no longer separates a comm sys from its disturbing outside but desc noise as an integral part of the ecology of comm."

We now talk about computers* in nearly identical ways to how we talk about the natural world. They are no longer separate technical objects but embedded, alive, and surrounding us in the landscape. They are not unlike a manicured garden (highly intricate, human-made) or a swamp (untended, sublime in their complexity). This builds from the idea of media ecology, but instead of a closed ecology of just the technical, it extends to our entire environment, computer and plant and animal.

* "computer" here in the broadest sense, meaning laptops, phones, tablets, servers, and other digital, networked devices

"[Speaking of how all eggs in a clutch are similarly colored so a parasitic bird can't easily insert their own in the nest] ...the knowledge of evolutionary forces affects how we see, and, hence, affects the aesthetic properties of eggs."

from "Scientific Knowledge and the Aesthetic Appreciation of Nature"
Patricia Matthews
Nature, Aesthetics, and Environmentalism: From Beauty to Duty
ed Allen Carlson and Sheila Lintott
pg 192

"The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the universe. It feeds on brain wave energy, absorbing all unconscious frequencies and then excreting telepathically a matrix formed from the conscious frequencies and nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language: the speech you hear decodes the brain wave matrix."

several random 3D walks from base to spiral
then interpolate between them across all other points?

- find nearest N neighbors
- get dist to use as weight
- do weighted average of the neighboring pts
- use that?

SLICES TO 3D MODEL IN FIJI

File > Import > Image Stack...
- convert to 8-bit gray (to be safe)
- sort numerically
- nothing else
- check everything is ok with arrow keys back and forth

Plugins > 3D Viewer...
- Display as > Surface (so it'll be a solid later)
- threshold 50 (since our image is binary)
- resampling factor: low val = higher res (try 2 to start, 1 will be really slow but super nice)

File > Export STL...
- save it out to file

In Rhino...
- import 
- mesh boolean > union if necessary
- "flip" command to reverse normals
- render and/or save

Parasite Rex
Carl Zimmer (2000)

"There's a parrot in Mexico with thirty different species of mites on its feathers alone. And the parasites themselves have parasites, and some of those parasites have parasites of their own."
p xxi

"Parasites make up the majority of species on Earth. According to one estimate, parasites may out-number free-living species four to one."
p xxi

idea that parasites were created by the body itself (never seen outside it), but that didn't work w Christian idea that God created all living things
or that parasites were created by God in Adam as helpers, who became bad after the fall
(p 5)

Couch's spadefoot toad lives underground, not eating for 11 months
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch%27s_spadefoot_toad
"It sits underground, not eating, not drinking. Its heart barely beats, but its cells still have to purr metabolically along, and it stores its wastes in its liver and bladder."
p 51

	- cites American Zoologist, 1990 30:313-324 – article by R. C. Tinsley, "The Influence of Parasitic Infection on Mating Success in Spadefoot Toads"

From "Human Parasitology"
Burton J Bogitish, Thomas N Oeltmann, and Clint E Carter
2005

"symbiosis" now means any two orgs that live together, regardless of harm or benefit - four types of symb are: 
- commensalism (lit. eating at the same table, not nec physical interaction)
- phoresis (from Greek to carry, no dependency in procurement of food)
- mutalism (depend on each other)

- parasitism
	- obligatory (like ticks) req host to survive
	- facultative are free living and become parasites when it serves them
	- endoparasites live inside, ectoparasites live attached to the outer surface
- hosts
	- defininitive = where parasite reaches sexual maturity
	- intermediate = temp but essential step
	- transfer or paratenic = not nec but "temp refuge and a vehicle for reaching an obligatory, usually the definitive, host in the cycle"
